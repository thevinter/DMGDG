title: Area 1 - The Mortuary Of the Plague-Struck
---
I finally started mappning my map and got to do the first Area. It doesn't have (at the moment) meaningful NPC interactions and will probably be tweaked in the future but I think it conveys the general feel of the dungeon in a decent way. Feel free to steal it.


# Backstory
The hidden colony was actually a colony of refugees from the nearby city prison of St.Barbara. The city was pillaged by pirates to free one of their leaders and the other prisoners managed to escape via small boats once the main walls were destroyed. This meant that around 200 prisoners, both men and women found themselves in perilous waters for 2 days before finally reaching the island of Layanaka. Knowing that they would be chased the prisoners started excavating a hidden town inside one of the mountains, hoping that one day their crimes and their faces would be forgotten. Sadly that never happened. After only a few months one of the women discovered a purple plant that had relaxing properties: people would be able to forget about their troubles and live a less stressful life in the colony. In less than a month everyone was consuming this plant on a daily basis. Then tragedy struck: little was known to them is that the plant had small parasites feasting on its leaves, parasites that got ingested during the meals and slowly started to grow until, one day, they started leaving the bodies of its inhabitants, dismembering them from the inside and taking ownership over the colony.

## Area 1: 1-15 The Mortuary Of the Plague-Struck

1. A big room with old cloaks and jackets hung on the eastern wall. The walls and the floor are covered in purple powder. 	
2. This room has rotten table a cabinet that contains a diary that contains the story of a man that escaped from St.Barbara and saw his loved one die in the waters.
3. This room is empty except for some barrels, now laying on the floor.
4. A giant distillery is present in this room, its floor is now covered in a purple mush made of rotten plants. Rotten purple plants can be found also in barrels. The distillery was used to produce a drink from the Phymes. The machine can be repaired in 1d4 days if a character is knowledgeable enough. The plant can be found outside of the dungeon and the effects of ingesting the drink will be described in a later post.
5. This place was once a small amphiteatre, now with ruined seats. If a player stands on the scene some **Dancing Lights** will appear encouraging the player to perform. The dm should encourage the player to roleplay something in character and if the exhibition is deemed appropriate then the PC will receive the **Bless** effect for *1d6*turns. Otherwhise a zapping sound will be heard and the PC will be hit by a small lightning for *1d4* damage.
6. 4 prisoners have risen as undeads, controlled by parasites in their corpses. Their skin is of a blue tint and small holes tatter their bodies. Stat as **Zombie** *(AC8/2HD/9,7,7,4/18THAC0/60'/1xClaw 1d8)* but when dead there's *1d6* chance that the **Parasite** *(AC9/2HP(1/2HD)/19THAC0/120'/Bite save vs Poison or become infected after 1d8 hours unless cured)* will escape the corpse to try and find another dead body to inhabit.
7. This room got infested by plants as they rose trough the cracks in the stones. Now this room is a vibrant forest of colors ranging from green to red. A hive of 9 **Killer Bees** *(AC7/2HP(1/2HD)/19THAC0/150'/Sting 1d3\*)* and 1 **Bee Queen** (same stats but with 2HD) hides behind the secret door. Thanks to cracks in the ceiling *1d4* bees are always present in the room while the rest dwell in the hide. The corpse of a woman can be found between the plants with **73gp** on it. If the players destroy the hive they can find 3 pieces of **Crystalized Honey** (**150g** ea.)
8. This area is also filled with plants and hides a deadly trap. A corpse can be seen from the entrance but when the players get close enough to it thick vines will come from the floor blocking the only entrance. At the same time from the vines will come out a thick yellow gas. (Save vs Poison or get blinded for 1d4 hours + after 10 rounds Save vs Poison again or die). The corpse contains a Scroll of Protection From Magic and 88gp.
9. This room contains 9 dead corpses, all with small pores on their skin and with their stomachs torn apart. They were all hosts to the Phyne Worms dwelling in **Area 9**.
10. A small **Bone Dagger** (**55gp**) is hidden under a woodden plank. A secret compartment in the east wall contains a pouch with **35ep** and two **gold teeth** (**10gp** ea.)
11. The smell in this room is revolting as one body is almost completely melted on the floor. An **Insect Swarm** *(7AC/2HD/14/18THAC0/60'/1xSwarm 2hp)* hovers around the body
12. Small crypts dot the corridor in what looks like the cemetary part of the Colony.
   -A **Carrion Crawler** *(AC7/3HD+1/13/19THAC0/60'/8xTentacles\* or 1xBite)* dwells in the alcoves 
   -B - The area in this alcove is murky. If a character enters to search it Save vs Magic or lose *1d4* Intelligence for *1d4* hours.
   -C/D - Empty 
   -E - A **broken compass** (22gp) can be found lying on the ground behind some rocks
   -F - 5 **Phyne Worms** are feasting on a Crawler's corpse. Stat as **Giant Centipede** *(AC9/2HP(1/2HD)/19THAC0/60'/1xBite Save vs Poison or take 1 damage/round (cumulative)*)
13. This giant crypt has 30 sarchopagi. One character can search 3 of them in 1 turn. Inside there are **233g**, **177s** an **Onyx Ring(77g)** and (only if all are searched) a **Girdle of Giant Strength.**
14 - A **Grey Ooze** *(AC8/3HD/13/17THAC0/10'/1xTouch 2d8)* guards a **Tiger Eye** (Translucent, rich brown with golden center under-hue) worth **65gp**
15 - A lever is present next to the door to the south. It stands in the middle. If moved downwards once it opens the door and returns to the middle, if moved upwards it closes the door and opens the door to Area 16 (while also returning to the middle). To open them both at the same time the lever must be pulled down twice. If it's pushed upwards twice it opens a spike trap under the PC. (1d6 damage + 1d6 spikes damage)
