## Make Them Draw!

# Why should you make your players draw their maps

One core principle in my games is that I insist on making my players draw their own maps with me just describing them. Am I a sadist? Probably, but that's besides the point. Map drawing should be present in every game and here's why:

It adds 5 layers of depth to the gameplay that you would otherwise miss.

1. **Item management:** Paper is fragile and gets wet, you can lose your map, you can lose your ink. Drawing maps forces your players to care about stuff like this.

2. **Decision management:** If you're running you're not mapping, if you're fighting you're not mapping. Being able to make decisions like that is just a plus.

3. **Being lost is fun:** When your players will run into a room where a wall was supposed to be on their map they'll freak out, and then they'll laugh and have fun. That also brings us to the next point

4. **More rewards:** Finally an NPC that can reveal some rooms or draw a map becomes more useful tham ever. I remember playing a session that our map was so fucked up that we were basically begging everyone to give us a real map. Fun times.

5. **Engagement:** If a player is drawing he's paying attention to the game, simple as.

So I hope I convinced you at least to try implementing this mechanic in your games, I promise you won't regret it.
