title: Introducing New Players
---
Sometimes people ask me how to introduce new players into d&d. 

Take a table, give them dice to fidget around.

"You're on a cliff and there's a cave next to you with red drapes flailing in the wind. You know there's a fuckton of treasure down there. What? I don't know. Magical mirrors and stuff. You hear a scream coming from below. What do you do?"

Great, you're now playing.
