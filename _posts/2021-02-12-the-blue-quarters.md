## Area 2: 16-32 The Blue Quarters
Those are supposed to be some sorts of living quarters for the prisoners. As usual the ideas are not final and will probably undergo some revisions. The factions are, once again, lacking, but I will probably add all of them in the end.

16. This room is full of broken statues. Lots of them. Passing trough is difficult and will trigger a random encounter check if enough noise is made. 
17. A malformed slime is in this room, its blue and shifting. He has teeth and sometimes he takes the form of someone that you love. **Blue Slime** *(AC6/2HD/8/18THAC0/40'/1xBite x 2d4 + Save vs Poison or get Chatmed)*. When he dies he dissolves, leaving on the ground a medallion with a photo of a woman worth 477gp.
18. This room was an alchemy lab, now it's full of broken glass vials and tables. 
19. A sleeping room, it has six beds, rotten and gray. On the northern wall a writing in blood that spells "Goodbye"
20. A smaller sleeping quarter with only four beds. A **Zombie** with no head stands in the middle of the room turned towards the northern wall. 
21. 3 **Phyne Worms** *(AC9/2HP(1/2HD)/19THAC0/60'/1xBite Save vs Poison or take 1 damage/round (cumulative))* are hanging from the ceiling. If the PCs are not careful they will try and fall on them, attaching themselves to the host and biting into his skin. A small clay figurine (45gp) can be found under one of the materasses. 
22. 5 **Dead Carillons** *(AC4/2HD/18THAC0/50'/1xBite 1d6, upon death a small insect will run out from their bodies producing some music)* are present in this room. They are undead that produce a slow and sad carillon sound whenever they move. They won't attack the PCs on sight and will react only if they make noise in their presence (they find it very irritating). In the middle of a room stands a cube made of glass, inside of the cube is a **Longsword +1.**
23. The door to this room is locked and trapped with a **swinging ball** (2d6 points of damage). Dexterity check for half. Inside the rooms looks like an old armory with armor stands and old rusted weapons. No weapon is salvageable but it one of the cabinets is a **black key** (opens Area 37)
24. Someone repurposed this room as a camp. Then, the occupant decided to end his life. In the middle of a room is a man wearing a leather armor, with a sword trough his stomach. Blue maggots are now crawling under his skin. The body holds nothing of value but if the PCs spend more than one turn in this room they'll start hearing whispers in their heads suggesting them to end their lives.  
25. A **Screaming Hummingbird** (AC9/1HD/19THAC0/120'/1xBite 1d4) has a nest in this room that is connected to the surface trough a small shaft. If the characters get too close to his nest he will first make a small screeching noise (Roll for random encounters) and if the party doesn't get back then he'll unleash a hellish scream (Roll for random encounters, 3-in-6 chances. Everyone hearing the scream will be deafened for 1d6 hours and 20% chance of remaining deaf for life). The nest contains 246sp, 37gp and a small hearth shaped bone. 
26. 3 more **Blue Zombies** can be found here (see Area 4). One of them holds a pouch that contains two opals (20g ea.)
27. This is the hiding place of **Rudus**, a small human thief that came here to retrieve the amulet in Area 38. He came to the Colony four days ago and found this secret room that he now uses to rest. He haven't found a way to open the door to Area 37. He is very opportunistic and vile. If he hears the PCs fighting in Area 26 he'll come out and propose them an alliance. He will do anything to avoid combat and to convince the party that, whatever their goal is, the path to it lies trough Area 37. If the PCs successefully recover the Amulet he'll try to run away with it as soon as possible.
28. A **Talking Statue** *(AC3/3HD/17THAC0/20'/1xSword 1d6)* is in the northern corner of the room. It will ask philosophical questions to everyone in the room. If the PCs ignore it or don't answer for more than 30 seconds while in the room the statue will close the door and animate , attacking the PCs while screaming "Why do we fight for?", "Our existance is based on assumptions" and similar phrases.

29. A giant plant is present in this room. It's 10' tall and with purple and blue leaves. Its roots extend deep into the floor and PCs inside the room can hear moans and whispers coming from the cracks as if hell itself is speaking to them. This room is an eternal struggle between **Parasites** *(AC9/2HP(1/2HD)/19THAC0/120'/Bite save vs Poison or become infected after 1d8 hours unless cured)* and the plant. Every turn from the cracks in the floor rises a cloud of gas that kills the parasites, but at the same time more vermin crawl inside trough the walls and the ceiling. A corpse lies between the worms and the plant's roots. It has a Hammer of Energy Drain and 55pp on him but recovering it would mean avoiding both the gas (2d8 damage, Save vs Poison halves) and the Parasites
30. A covered mirror hangs in this room. If the cover is removed whoever watches inside will be teleported into a Violet World and will be forced to fight a copy of himself. Defeating the copy is the only way of escaping. 
31. This room was started but never finished. It was supposed to be a hall but its construction got interrupted because of an underground lake. A small **Hydra** (5HD) took the lake as his lair (there is an underwater passage that connects the small lake with a bigger one). Inside the lake there's a wooden chest that can be seen from outside. The hydra has only a 10% of being present in the room but will come after 3 rounds whenever someone enters the lake to retrieve the chest (taking it outside requires at least 5 minutes). The container holds 1433gp, 3661sp and 4293cp as well as 2 diamonds (500gp ea.)
32. This room is empty and partially collapsed. A body lies smashed by the rocks but holds nothing of value.
