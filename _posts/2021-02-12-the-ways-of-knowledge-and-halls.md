## Area Three: 33-38: The Ways Of Knowledge

**33** - The tree different areas have shafts extending out to the surface. Red and purple vines crawl down the walls, the sun not visible probably covered by foliage. Every area has a giant statue, 10ft high. Every statue has a mask, big as a man, that, when removed, reveals an open area behind it. Taking off each mask is hard but can be done by climbing on the statue's back and removing the big iron locks.
	A - Hideous face with no mouth or nose and with 20 eyes. Behind is an a group of 28 **Gorbels** *(AC3(10\*)/2HD/19THAC0/120'/1xExplosion 1d6 or 1xClaw 1d4)* they will fall into the room as soon as the mask is removed and escape into other rooms of the dungeon.
	B - A feline mask with real tiger teeth. A giant **Gas Spore** lingers in the area. Every PC that enters the head will mistake it for a Beholder.
	C - A completely black mask. The insides of the head are filled to the brim by mouths that will start screaming as soon as the mask is removed. Inbetween the mouths are precious gems that can be removed (3 gems worth 100gp e.a. every 10 minutes but roll two extra Random Encounter Checks. A total of 15 gems).
**34** - This room is completely red. Art pieces are hanging on the wall, some of them are destroyed others still preserved. They're protected by a magical field that permeates the room so taking them outside will prove almost impossible. There is a set of stairs that leads nowhere, a painting of an empty 10ft. white room that can actually can be entered and an image of a blue and white circle cold to the touch. In the middle of the room stands a **Metal Warrior** *(AC4/3HD/17THAC0/50'/2xSword 1d6)*, a small humanoid made out of metal that served both as a critic and a guardian for the gallery. As soon as the PCs enter he will activated and, in a broken state, will start asking opinions about the art pieces. If the party leaves without giving a satisfactory answer he will attack.
**35** - This a library, but most books are completely white. Some of them are actually stuck to the bookshelves and can't be removed. A thorough exploration (3 Turns) reveals a book containing a brief description of the mechanism of Area 37 and a book containing a brief description of the colony.
**36** - A dead body sits on a chair, face deep in a book he was writing, his stomach torn apart. The host has long escaped and the book is too permeated in blood to be read. A **Banshee** haunts this place *(AC3/7HD/13THAC0/1xClaw 1d8 or 1xDeath Wail\*)*. The Banshee will not pursue the players outside of the room. The body holds a Potion Of Healing and a Golden Knife (322g). The secret room can be accessed both from this area and area 35 by examinging a bookcase. The room contains the bones of a dead woman that, if removed from this place, will put the banshee to rest. There is also a **Wand Of Fear** with 6 charges.
**37** - This door is made of metal and it's closed and the key can be found in Area 23. The door can't be forced or destroyed by normal means (a knock spell will work). This area is dedly. The middle of the room has a pressure plate that is likely to activate when the party enters to investigate. Pressing it will close the door behind them and turn on 6 **Statues** *(AC-2/3HD/14THAC0/90')* (3 for each end of the room) that will simply take the PCs with force and throw them into Area 38. Each statue has a switch on the neck that turns it off. If Rudus is with the party he'll stay outside of the room with an excuse. He knows that the area is trapped and doesn't want to risk it.
**38** - Lots of corpses are laid on the floor, all dead and with no eyeballs in the sockets. If the party is thrown into the room the door will immediately close and the oxygen will start to be sucked out of the room, this will not be noticeable at first but by examining the corpses it can be inferred that everyone died by asphyxia. After 1 turn in the room everyone will die and after 2 turns the door will open again. Purposefully no solution to this room is provided as to not influence the DM. One of the corpses holds the **Amulet of Shenarh**: Seven large ovals of onyx set in forged gold adorn this Amulet. When worn the user gets +2 to all of their stats, but forges a pact with the demon contained within. This ultimately dooms the wearer of the amulet that, unless decursed, will die in 1d6 weeks by violent means even if the amulet is removed. This is the item that Rudus is looking for.

## Area Four: 39-48: The Thorn Halls

**39** - This room is pitch black and no light can pass trough.
**40** - A table with a hundred black skulls laid on it. If even one of the skulls is touched the PC that touched will hear a maniacal laughter in their head.
**41** - A **Blue Serpent** *(AC7/2HD/18THAC0/80'/1xBite 1d6 Save Vs Poison or become sick after 1d4 hours. Anyone sick will vomit blue blood for 3 days)* dwells in the ruins. It's blue, almost ethereal. He will not attack any creature infested with parasites. If dead he'll become mist and dissolve. Add him to the Random Encounters table. The secret room contains a Scroll of Stone To Flesh and a crystal pitcher (3000g, 50% chance of breaking every time the owner takes damage)
**42** - This room contains a scene similar to area 40, except this time the table is full of red bones. If one of the bones is touched they will all vibrate and slowly fall to the floor one by one.
**43** - 3 **Blue Zombies** can be found here (see Area 4). Purple flowers grow out of their skin. Whenever those zombies are hit there's a 30% chance that the flowers will release a cloud of spores incapacitating everyone next to the zombie for 1 round.
**44** - This room is empty and holds ruined gardening supplies and rotten seeds. 
**45** - This is a Hydrophonics Greenhouse where different flowers grow.
	A - Orifax Blooms - Red flowers that smeel of blood and feel wet to the touch
	B - Phyne Flowers - Can be distilled into a tranquilizing but deadly drink. If inspected closely some miniscule blue worms can be seen
	C - Soer Vines - Hideous fleshy vines, they smell horribly and sting if touched
	D - Blachids - The smell of this flower is deadly. Anyone getting close must Save vs Poison or take 1d6 damage and vomit for 1 turn. If a second save is failed then the character dies. Inside the bulb of the flowers small gems grow that are worth 500gp e.a. (4 total)
**46** - The ceiling of this room is an endless night. Red orchids grow on the floor, reaching almost 1 feet of height. 
**47** - The ceiling of this room is an endless sun. Blue orchids grow on the floor, similarly to room 45. A Tiger Beetle (10AC/2+1HD/16THAC0/1xBite 2d4). The Parasites made it more fragile but with each hit it has a 10% of transmitting the infection) infested with Parasites hides in the flowers
**48** - This room is massive and it's completely covered in blue vines and flowers. Water drips from the ceiling and mist hovers 2 inches above the floor. **Atriel Vox** *(3AC/4HD/16THAC0/60'/2xCurved Blade 1d6)* wanders the room, unable to find peace. He's 10ft. tall, his veins are visible from afar, his eyes are clouded with mist. He's not immediately hostile to the party, and he will ask them to end his misery. If the party refuses then he will attack them, but he will take a "Later" as an answer. If a fight ensues every other round a **Whirling Mist** *(8AC/1HD/19THAC0/120'/1x1d6 Save Vs Paralysis or lose 1 round)* will appear: a humanoid figure made of mist, to difficult to concentrate upon. Whenever it passes trough someone it makes him remember his worst mistakes in life. Atriel won't give up without a fight even if it's his desire to die. If attacked he will proceed to take out two blades from his mouth, spilling purple blood everywhere, and use them to attack the players. The throne in the middle of the room is magical. If used when Atriel is dead it will grant the user control over the mist allowing him to spawn one Whirling Mist under his control while inside the room or inside a misty area.
**49** - This room is filled with invisible gas that filters from the cracks in the floor. Whenever someone enters this room make them Save Vs Paralysis. If they succed end exit immediately nothing happens, otherwhise they get paralyzed for 1 turn (Roll for Random Encounters). The cupboards hold some pouches with 30gp 41pp and 433sp.
